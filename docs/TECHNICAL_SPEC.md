# Mental Health Crisis Support App - Technical Specifications

## Overview
A peer-to-peer mental health support app focused on quick and effective crisis communication through a simple status system and trusted friend networks.

- **Send Pre-made Message**: Choose from pre-written check-in messages

#### Visual Design:
- Action buttons with clear iconography (phone, message, chat icons)
- Consistent rounded button style (12dp border radius)
- High contrast colors for accessibility
- Loading states with gentle spinner animations
- Success feedback with checkmark animation

### 6. Pre-made Message System

#### Yellow Status Messages (Gentle):
- "Thinking of you today"
- "How are you doing?"
- "Here if you need to talk"
- "Sending you good vibes"

#### Red Status Messages (Urgent):
- "I'm here for you right now"
- "Can I call you?"
- "You're not alone - I'm here"
- "I care about you and want to help"

## User Flow

### Status Update Flow
1. User opens app
2. User sees three large status buttons (Green/Yellow/Red)
3. User taps appropriate status
4. Status is updated in real-time
5. If Yellow or Red, friends receive notifications

### Friend Response Flow
1. Friend receives push notification about status change
2. Friend opens app or responds from notification
3. Friend sees three options: Call, Text, or Send Message
4. Friend selects appropriate response method
5. Communication is initiated

### Friend Management Flow
1. User searches for friend by username/email
2. Friend request is sent
3. Recipient receives notification
4. Recipient accepts or denies request
5. If accepted, users are added to each other's friend lists
